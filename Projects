PIPELINE

Pricing Optimization
-List of products and their prices, along with other customer profile data.
-Regression on customer data points that have significant effect on higher total revenue.
-Payer score based on residual between predicted revenue and actual revenue.
-WTP = confusion matrix of actual revenue compared to average (k-means); payer score.
    positive k-means and underpayer -> price hike
    positive k-means and overpayer -> no touch
    negative k-means and underpayer -> x-sell
    negative k-means and overpayer -> churn risk
